### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Lab 2, part 1 was a favorite because converting Fahrenheit to Celsius is a straightforward idea. The instructions were also very clear and made it easier to understand what I was doing. This assignment introduced me to coding and helped me become more familiar with GitHub and how to start using C++. 

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 1 was another favorite because the sandwich mad lib assignment allowed me to fill in the blanks of a sentence with whatever I wanted. I liked the fact that I could interact with what I made more freely. I also liked learning about std::string variables.

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 1 was also a favorite of mine because I think a program that can easily calculate the difference between dates even when they are really far apart is interesting. Even though this information might not be very helpful or valuable, I still think it is cool to know. I also liked this lab because it introduced us to makefiles, which are very useful.
